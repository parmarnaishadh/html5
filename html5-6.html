                <p><mark>Dubai offers visitors a kaleidoscope of attractions. An example is the Museum of the Future, an exhibition space for innovative and futuristic ideologies, services and products. In addition, visitors can explore its contrasting landscapes, archaeological sites and a natural seawater inlet, known as The Creek, which cuts cross the city centre and is the “focal point of life in Dubai.” Among its top attractions are the Burj Khalifa, Dubai Mall and Palm Jumeirah.13

                    To meet growing demands from the tourism sector, Dubai has developed extensive, world-class hospitality and tourism facilities.14 Dubai hosted 7.12 million international visitors in the first half of 2022, nearly three times the 2.52 million tourists recorded in the same period in 2021. The surge in visitors is attributed to the momentum generated by Expo 2020 which ended on 31 March 2022, and the emirate’s status as a safe destination. Leisure and business events, including the Dubai Shopping Festival, the World Government Summit and the Arabian Travel Market, also boosted visitor numbers.15
